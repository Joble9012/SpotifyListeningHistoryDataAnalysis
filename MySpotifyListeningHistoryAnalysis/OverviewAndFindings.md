# Project Overview  

This project dives into my personal Spotify listening history to see what my music habits really look like—what I listen to most, when I listen, and how those patterns change over time. I downloaded my full Spotify history as multiple JSON files, each packed with details like timestamps, track and artist names, and play duration in milliseconds. My first step was to pull everything together into one clean CSV file. Along the way, I removed extra columns I didn’t need (things like platform details, IP addresses, and audiobook fields), filtered out odd outliers (like the “White Noise 3 Hour Long” track), made sure the dates were in a consistent format, converted milliseconds to minutes, and kept only plays from 2018 onward.
Once the data was in good shape, I used pandas to start digging into it. I looked at who my top artists were, which tracks I played the most, and how much time I’ve spent listening overall. I also made sure to fix missing values, rename columns so they made more sense, and drop entries with incomplete info. With everything tidied up, the dataset became much easier to work with and gave a clearer picture of my listening habits without all the extra noise.

From there, I ran some descriptive stats and made visualizations to spot patterns. I calculated total listening hours, my most-played artists and songs, and which tracks I’ve spent the most time on. The data gave me some interesting insights into how my tastes have shifted, what artists I keep coming back to, and when I’m most likely to be listening. There’s still room to dig deeper—like looking at seasonal patterns, breaking things down by genre, or figuring out how time of day impacts what I play—but this gave me a solid foundation to start understanding my own music habits in detail.

# Findings  

**1. Lowest Listening Day**  
Sunday consistently has the least amount of listening time. I believe this is because I usually spend Sundays with family and relatives, going to church, or running errands, which leaves less time for music.  

**2. Consistent Top Artists**  
Post Malone and Juice WRLD have consistently appeared among my top artists and songs over the years. This suggests a long-term preference for their music, regardless of other trends in my listening habits.  

**3. Peak Listening Time**  
My peak time for playing music is around **3:00 PM**, which could be tied to afternoon activities or a natural energy boost during the day.  

**4. Monthly Listening Patterns**  
I initially thought there might be a particular month that stood out as my highest listening month, but the data shows that it varies each year, with no single month dominating across all years.
